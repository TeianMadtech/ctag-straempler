The following changes have been made to the Helix MP3 decoder source code
for porting on to the PIC32MX microcontroller. 

1. Commented out the assembly implementation of FASTABS() function in
assembly.h and replaced with the C equivalent.

2. Commented out the line 47 in file mp3dec.h as this may not be 
applicable to the PIC32.
